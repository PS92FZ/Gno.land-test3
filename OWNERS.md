Here is the steering committee, effectively the owners, of this repository.
Additional members can be added by 2/3 agreement, by adding the approvals inline.
The steering commitee is a set of people and organizations for consultation of
last resort for strategic decisions, and is not liable for anything decided here.

[AIB, Ignite, ???]

NOTE: 2/3 is required to invite, so to add next we must get agreement from
floor(2/3 * N), or 2 members.
